### Thoughts - Redis Day Bangalore 2020

Redis Day Bangalore 2020 was a whirlwind experience. This is a brief summary of the two days. The official home for Redis Day Bangalore  - [https://connect.redislabs.com/redisdaybangalore](https://connect.redislabs.com/redisdaybangalore "https://connect.redislabs.com/redisdaybangalore")

### DAY 1 (Jan 21st)

I thought Redis was a tool for caching and only an alternative for memcache. I couldnâ€™t be more off-target. I was blown away by the multitude of tools/features under Redis.

This day was all about introduction and training on different modules offered by Redis.

1. Redis Streaming Architectures
   * Introduction to Redis streaming.
   * Hands-on session on Creating streams.
   * Creating consumer groups
2. Redis Data Modeling & Patterns
   * Sets
   * Sorted Sets
   * Bit field manipulation - Using Bits to record events in per min/per day
3. Redis Clustering
   * Hashing to divide the keys among the Redis nodes
   * Using Redis Open source cluster
   * Comparison to Redis Enterprise
4. RedisTimeSeries OR RediSearch
   * Introduction to RedisTimeSeries
   * Creating RedisTimeSeries
5. Probabilistic Data Structures
   * Redis P11c Data Structures
   * Bloom Filters

All the session slides are available [here](https://bit.ly/redis-bangalore-slides "here")
