## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

<span style="color:grey">Senior Member of Technical Staff &#8226; 2019-May to Current</span> 


Building functionality for core [Oracle cloud infrastructure platform](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/iaas "OCI"). This is the IAAS cloud offering by Oracle similar to AWS.

* Microservices based
* Large scale
* Truly distributed
* N-tier architecture
* Deeply nested hierarcy
* High level of Abstraction
* High impact

Features implemented -

1. Worked on scaling feature of OCI, which enables VM to be scaled-out or scaled-in, based on cookie-cutter sizes, like XS, S, M, L, XL. Also worked on bespoke scaling for VM that are custom sizes.

2. Built monitoring using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/ "Prometheus") and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/ "Grafana")

Technologies: `java`, `python`, `gradle`, `swagger`, `mockito`, `docker`, `HK2`, `Unix shell`
