## Coding Assessment Product

<span style="color:grey">Software engineer &#8226; 2010-March to 2010-September</span>

Application that executes user submitted code via testing framework. Correctness of the code (checking inheritance, implementation of interfaces) is evaluated using Reflection. Also create algorithmic problems for evaluting alogrithm skills. Created coding games as well.

Technologies: `java`, `jsp`, `tomcat`, `unix`
